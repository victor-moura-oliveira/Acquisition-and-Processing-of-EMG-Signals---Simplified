## **About this Project**
Hello everyone, in this project I sought to transform the analysis, processing and control of biomedical signals into a simple topic, proposing to work with tools that are easy to access and understand.
For acquisition I used a ready-made low cost circuit "M1NBY", but you can also use a homemade circuit with instrumentation amplifier using conventional electrodes.
To receive the signal I used an Arduino UNO, but you can easily use a microcontroller, the idea is the same.
Data were stored in a spreadsheet with the company's PARALLAX software (plx_daq).	
The analysis and processing was done using the "matlab" software from the company mathworks. A very good software that makes it possible to import EMG signals allocated in archives ".xlsx" into the code in a simple way.
*OBS: If you want to use the system to control a robotic prosthesis or something like that, you just need the acquisition circuit and a microcontroller (or Arduino).*
